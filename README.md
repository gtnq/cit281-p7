# cit281-p7
Learning Objectives

Gain more experience working with GitHub repos

Gain experience working with GitHub Pages

Create an initial CIT Minor portfolio for your labs and projects



Overview

Rather than a final coding project, this project consists of creating an initial version of your CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. This project includes:

Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio.

Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class

Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture

Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects

Important: As part of Lab 7, you created an organization for your GitHub account, but you do not have to use this organization with your repositories.

Tip: See a Showcase (Links to an external site.) of web pages created using Jekyll. Also, documentation, guides, and samples are available for the README.md markdown syntax.
